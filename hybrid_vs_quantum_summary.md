## Conclusion

The hybrid ToM models demonstrate a small but consistent performance advantage over pure quantum models, achieving 96.9% vs 96.5% overall accuracy. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational overhead (~1.25x slower training) and higher parameter count (~18% more parameters).

**Key Trade-offs:**
- **Hybrid Models**: Better performance, more stable training, higher computational cost
- **Quantum Models**: Faster training, more parameter-efficient, slightly lower performance

For most applications, the choice between hybrid and quantum models depends on the specific requirements:
- **Performance-critical**: Choose hybrid models
- **Resource-constrained**: Choose quantum models
- **Research/development**: Use both for comparative analysis

Both approaches show excellent performance on ToM tasks, with the hybrid approach providing a small but meaningful improvement at the cost of increased computational complexity.

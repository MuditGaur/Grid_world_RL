# Quantum Belief States & Theory of Mind: Complete Conversation

*Date: [Current Date]*  
*Topic: Quantum vs Classical Belief State Representations in POMDPs*

---

## Summary

This conversation explores the implementation and comparison of classical, quantum, and hybrid belief state representations in a Theory of Mind (ToM) framework using a gridworld POMDP environment. The discussion covers architectural changes, performance comparisons, and the theoretical foundations of why quantum approaches show advantages in handling uncertainty and partial observability.

## Key Technical Concepts

### Theory of Mind (ToM)
- The ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents, desires) to oneself and others
- Critical for social AI and human-AI interaction
- Tested through false-belief scenarios where agent beliefs differ from reality

### Gridworld POMDP
- Partially observable Markov decision process environment
- 9×9 grid with 4 objects, 1 agent, 1 subgoal
- Hidden object swaps create false-belief scenarios
- Agent has limited field of view (3×3), observer sees full state

### Belief State Representations
- **Classical**: Traditional neural network belief states
- **Quantum**: Variational quantum circuits via PennyLane
- **Hybrid**: Combination of classical and quantum components

---

## Architectural Evolution

### Original Architecture (State Encoding Varied)
```
Agent Observation (5×3×3) → [Classical/Quantum/Hybrid State Encoder] → Encoded State → Belief State → Policy
```

### New Architecture (Belief State Varied)
```
Agent Observation (5×3×3) → State Encoder → [Classical/Quantum/Hybrid Belief State] → Policy
```

**Key Insight**: The architectural change shifted the point of variation from raw state encoding to belief state representation, making comparisons fairer and more focused on the nature of belief representation itself.

## POMDP Framework Analysis

### Environment Structure
```
Gridworld: 9×9 grid with:
├── Walls: Border + random internal walls (p_wall = 0.1)
├── Agent: Single agent with 5 actions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, STAY)
├── Subgoal: Single subgoal location (triggers swap mechanism)
├── Objects: 4 distinct objects (kinds 0-3) at different positions
└── Field of View: 3×3 grid around agent position
```

### POMDP Components

#### State Space (S)
- Full state: All object positions, agent position, wall layout, swap status
- State transitions: Deterministic movement + probabilistic swaps
- State size: ~9² × 4! × 2 = ~1,296 possible configurations

#### Action Space (A)
```python
A = {UP(0), DOWN(1), LEFT(2), RIGHT(3), STAY(4)}
ACTIONS = [(0,-1), (0,1), (-1,0), (1,0), (0,0)]
```

#### Observation Space (O)
- Agent observation: 5×3×3 tensor (wall + 4 object channels)
- Observer observation: 17D feature vector (full state information)
- Partial observability: Agent sees only FOV, observer sees everything

#### Transition Function (T)
```python
def step(self, action: Action) -> Dict:
    # 1. Agent movement (deterministic)
    dx,dy = ACTIONS[action]
    new_pos = agent_pos + (dx,dy)
    if valid(new_pos): agent_pos = new_pos
    
    # 2. Swap mechanism (probabilistic)
    if agent_pos == subgoal_pos and random() < p_swap:
        shuffle(objects)  # Permute object positions
```

### Partial Observability Mechanisms

#### Field of View Limitation
```python
FOV = 3×3 grid around agent
Agent sees: Objects within FOV only
Observer sees: Full 9×9 grid state
```

#### Hidden Swap Mechanism
```python
Swap conditions:
1. Agent reaches subgoal position
2. Random probability (p_swap = 0.25)
3. Objects permute positions
4. If swap outside FOV → False belief created
```

#### False Belief Creation
```python
Before swap: Agent believes object A at (3,4)
Swap occurs: Object A moves to (7,8) outside FOV  
After swap: Agent still believes object A at (3,4) ← FALSE BELIEF
```

## Agent Types & Strategies

### BeliefAgent (Rule-Based)
```python
class BeliefAgent:
    def _update_beliefs(self, env):
        # Only update beliefs for objects IN FOV
        for obj in env.objects:
            if obj in FOV:
                beliefs[obj.kind] = obj.pos
        # Objects outside FOV: beliefs unchanged (potentially false!)
    
    def act(self, env):
        # Move toward believed target location
        target = beliefs.get(preferred_kind)
        if target: move_toward(target)
        else: explore_randomly()
```

**POMDP Strategy**:
- Belief state: Maintains persistent beliefs about object locations
- Belief update: Only when objects visible in FOV
- Action selection: Greedy movement toward believed target
- Exploration: Random movement when target unknown

### QLearnAgent (Learning-Based)
```python
class QLearnAgent:
    def _state_code(self, env):
        # Discretized state representation:
        # (dx_sign_to_target, dy_sign_to_target, wall_front, wall_left, wall_right)
        return (dx_sign, dy_sign, wall_sensors)
    
    def act(self, env):
        state = self._state_code(env)
        action = argmax(Q[state])  # ε-greedy selection
```

**POMDP Strategy**:
- State discretization: Coarse state representation for tractability
- Q-learning: Learn value function over discretized states
- Exploration: ε-greedy policy (ε = 0.2)
- Reward shaping: Distance-based rewards for learning

## Quantum Advantage Analysis

### Why Quantum State Encoding Performed Better (Original Architecture)

#### Rich Feature Extraction
- Quantum circuits can extract more complex, non-linear features from the 17-dimensional state input
- Angle embedding + StronglyEntanglingLayers create sophisticated feature representations
- Quantum measurement provides multiple perspectives on the same input state

#### Higher Dimensional Representation
- Quantum circuits with 8 qubits can represent 2^8 = 256 different basis states
- This provides much richer state representations than classical MLPs with similar parameter counts
- The exponential state space of quantum systems allows for more expressive feature learning

#### Non-Linear Transformations
- Quantum gates perform highly non-linear transformations that classical networks struggle to replicate
- Entanglement creates complex correlations between different state features
- Quantum interference allows for sophisticated feature combination

### Why Quantum Belief States Excel at False Beliefs (Current Architecture)

#### Uncertainty Representation
- Quantum superposition naturally represents uncertainty and multiple possible states simultaneously
- Entanglement allows the model to maintain correlations between different aspects of the belief state
- Quantum interference can help resolve conflicting information more effectively

#### Probabilistic Reasoning
- Quantum measurement inherently involves probabilistic outcomes
- This aligns well with the uncertainty inherent in Theory of Mind reasoning
- Better suited for representing "beliefs about beliefs"

#### Entanglement and Correlation
- Quantum entanglement can maintain correlations between different aspects of the agent's mental state
- This is crucial for ToM where different mental attributes (beliefs, desires, intentions) are interconnected
- Classical networks struggle to maintain such complex correlations efficiently

## Inherent Uncertainty in the Environment

### Primary Source of Uncertainty: Partial Observability

#### Field of View (FOV) Limitation
- Agent FOV: 3×3 grid around agent position (configurable)
- Observer sees: Full 9×9 grid state
- Agent sees: Only objects within FOV + walls
- Hidden areas: Objects outside FOV are completely unknown to the agent

#### False Belief Creation
```python
# Swap occurs with probability p_swap = 0.25 after subgoal visit
if (not self.swapped) and self.agent_pos == self.subgoal_pos and self.rng.random() < self.p_swap:
    # Objects are permuted - if outside FOV, agent doesn't know!
    self.rng.shuffle(self.objects)
```

### Types of Uncertainty in the State Space

#### Spatial Uncertainty
- Object positions outside FOV: Agent has no information about these
- Dynamic changes: Objects can swap positions without agent knowledge
- Belief vs Reality gap: Agent's beliefs may be completely wrong after hidden swaps

#### Temporal Uncertainty
- Swap timing: Swaps occur randomly after subgoal visit (p_swap = 0.25)
- Last swap step: Agent doesn't know when swaps occurred
- Belief staleness: Beliefs become outdated when objects move unseen

#### Observational Uncertainty
- Binary observation: Objects either visible (1) or not visible (0) in FOV
- No distance information: Within FOV, agent only knows presence/absence
- No object identity: Agent must track object types across observations

## Quantum Embedding & Observational Incompleteness

### The Core Insight

**Quantum embeddings can better represent the inherent incompleteness** in the agent's observations, which directly addresses the fundamental challenge of partial observability in our POMDP.

### How Quantum Embeddings Handle Incompleteness

#### Superposition for Unknown States
```python
# Classical approach: Must choose specific values
classical_encoding = [1, 0, 0, 0]  # Assumes object at position 1

# Quantum approach: Can maintain superposition
quantum_state = α|position_1⟩ + β|position_2⟩ + γ|position_3⟩ + δ|position_4⟩
# Represents uncertainty about object location
```

#### Entanglement for Correlated Uncertainty
```python
# When one object is unknown, others may be correlated
quantum_state = |obj1_unknown⟩ ⊗ |obj2_unknown⟩ ⊗ |obj3_unknown⟩ ⊗ |obj4_unknown⟩
# Quantum entanglement maintains correlations between uncertainties
```

### Why This Improves Performance

#### Better Uncertainty Representation
```python
# Agent observes: [wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall, wall]
# Classical encoding: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # All zeros
# Quantum encoding: Superposition of possible object configurations
# "I don't know where objects are, but they could be in any combination"
```

#### Information Preservation
```python
# Classical networks often lose information about uncertainty
# They tend to converge to deterministic mappings
# Quantum circuits preserve uncertainty through superposition
```

#### Non-Linear Feature Learning
```python
# Quantum circuits can learn complex patterns in incomplete data
# They can extract features that classical networks miss
# Better at handling "unknown unknowns"
```

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Quantum Probability Theory
```python
# Classical probability: P(A) + P(B) = 1
# Quantum probability: |α|² + |β|² = 1, but α and β can interfere
# This allows for richer uncertainty representation
```

#### Information Content
```python
# Classical encoding: log₂(n) bits for n possible states
# Quantum encoding: Can represent 2^n states with n qubits
# Exponential representational capacity for uncertainty
```
